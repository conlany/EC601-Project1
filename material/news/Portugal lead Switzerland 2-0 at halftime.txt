Portugal go into the break with a 2-0 lead over Switzerland in their Round of 16 match.

Underdogs coming in, the Swiss got off to a bright start. Striker Breel Embolo had a shot deflected in the 5th minute that earned his side a corner.

But it was the Portuguese side that truly showed their quality in the first 45 minutes.

In the 17th minute, 21-year-old forward Gon√ßalo Ramos found the top corner of the net with a booming strike at the near post to give his side the lead. 

After the goal, Ramos continued to pester the Swiss backline and their defense appeared unlocked at times throughout the half.

In the 29th minute, Embolo earned the Swiss side a free kick when he was fouled as he drove forward in the Portuguese half. On the ensuing attempt, Xherdan Shaqiri bent one just wide of the net.

Just a few minutes later, Pepe doubled Portugal's advantage. The 39-year-old got his head to a Portuguese corner kick to make 2-0.

Ramos nearly made it three for the Portuguese when he sprinted past Switzerland's defense on a counterattack late in the half. A diving save by Yann Sommer kept it at 2-0. Still, the Swiss look like they're barely hanging on going into halftime.

If the result holds, Portugal will book their spot in the World Cup quarterfinals. They would face Morocco Saturday.
