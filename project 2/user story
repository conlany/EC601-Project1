Project-2
Phase 1: Twitter APIs In this part, I wrote several test programs to exercise different twitter APIs.

Getting Start
Setting up Twitter API authentication

Installing the client library: setting up a python development environment first; then install the library.

Setting up authentication: Create new account and select a project. Create a service account key and a JSON key file will be downloaded to your computer. Provide authentication credentials to your application code

Run the program:

python Home_timeline_twitters.py

python Google_NPL.py Home_timeline_tweets_results.txt

Set the results:

This tweet is used to test Twitter API.
